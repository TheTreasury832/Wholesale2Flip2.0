MAO (75%) = (ARV × 0.75) - Rehab Cost
```

### Lead Scoring Algorithm
```
Base Score: 60 points
+ Motivation (High: +20, Medium: +10, Low: +0)
+ Equity (50%+: +20, 30-50%: +15, 10-30%: +10, <10%: +0)  
+ Timeline (ASAP: +15, 30-60 days: +8, 60+ days: +0)
+ Source (Referral: +15, PPC: +12, RVM: +8, etc.)
```

### Deal Grading System
- **Grade A:** MAO ≥ 60% of ARV (Excellent deals)
- **Grade B:** MAO ≥ 55% of ARV (Good deals)
- **Grade C:** MAO ≥ 50% of ARV (Marginal deals)
- **Grade D:** MAO < 50% of ARV (Poor deals)
